## Release Notes

### [1.1.0]

#### Added
- Added Methods in `Microsoft.Data.Encryption.Cryptography.DataProtector`

1. **`Decrypt(byte[] input, int inputOffset, int inputLength, byte[] output, int outputOffset) -> int`**  
   - This method implements decryption functionality that processes a portion of the input byte array and writes the decrypted data into the output byte array. The return value indicates the number of bytes written. By defining output buffer this can significantly reduce allocations.

2. **`Encrypt(byte[] input, int inputOffset, int inputLength, byte[] output, int outputOffset) -> int`**  
   - This methos implement encryption functionality that processes a portion of the input byte array and writes the encrypted data into the output byte array. The return value indicates the number of bytes written. By defining output buffer this can significantly reduce allocations.

3. **`GetDecryptByteCount(int inputSize) -> int`**  
   - Returns *upper bound* of bytes required for decryption output based on the given input size.

4. **`GetEncryptByteCount(int inputSize) -> int`**  
   - Returns the number of bytes required for encryption output based on the given input size.

#### Changed
- `AeadAes256CbcHmac256EncryptionAlgorithm` is now sealed.
- `CryptographyExtensions.FromHexString` implementation is 2-3x faster while allocating 90-97% less memory (applicable only to .NET6.0+)
